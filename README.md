Your website should have the following functionality for users:
- Users should be able to login
- Users should be able to choose a habit they want to track (e.g water, exercise, 8 hours of sleep) and choose the frequency at which they want to track the habit.
- Users should be able to track a habit and mark it as complete for the day.
- Users should be able to see if they have completed a habit for the day and see if they have a streak of completing their habits.

Your website should have the following technical functionality:
- Developers should host a database to store the daily information about users.
